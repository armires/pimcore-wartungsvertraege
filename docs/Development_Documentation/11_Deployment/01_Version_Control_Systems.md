# Version Control Systems

Best practise for nearly every development workflow is to store source code in a version control system like SVN or GIT. 
Of course this is also possible with Pimcore. 

Since Pimcore creates lots of temporary files during runtime and also stores assets etc. in the file system, not every
  file in document root of Pimcore should be added to a VCS repository. 


### GIT Ignore

Following git ignore file is used by the Pimcore team:  


```
.idea/
.idea_modules/
node_modules/
!website/var/
website/var/*
!website/var/config/
website/var/config/*.mmdb
!website/var/classes/
website/var/classes/Object
vendor/
 
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# tests
/tests/output/*
/tests/tmp/*

# composer
/composer.phar
/composer.lock
/vendor/*
!/vendor/.dummy

# misc
/php-cs-fixer.phar
```

These rules ignore files generated by IDE, cache files, tmp files and external libraries updated by Composer.

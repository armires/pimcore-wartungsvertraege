# Add your own Dependencies and Packages

Pimcore is 100% compatible to composer and it's very easy to use additional libraries 
installed via composer ([http://getcomposer.org/](http://getcomposer.org/)) in Pimcore. 

So additional functionality (like external libraries, ... ) needed in your application 
can be added and loaded. 


## Basic Example
In this example we want to use some components of Symfony2 within our Pimcore project. 

#### Let's start: 
Go to the document-root of your project and just follow the usual composer setup. 
Add the desired package to the `composer.json` and define your dependencies: 
```php
{
    "require": {
        // ...
        // pimcore core dependencies
        // ...
        // your custom packages: ...
        "symfony/stopwatch": "*"
    }
}
```

Download and install composer from [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/) 

#### Install dependencies:
```php
composer update
```

#### Use the newly added components

That's it! Now you can use all components of Symfony in your Pimcore project, no need to 
do anything further, it just works! 

Now you can use the installed libraries anywhere in your code. 

In this very basic example we use the Stopwatch component in an action: 
```php
<?php
 
use Pimcore\Controller\Action;
use Symfony\Component\Stopwatch\Stopwatch;
 
class TestController extends Action {
 
    public function stopwatchTestAction() {
 
        $stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
        // Start event named 'eventName'
        $stopwatch->start('eventName');
        // ... some code goes here
        $event = $stopwatch->stop('eventName');
 
        print_r($event);
 
        exit;
    }
 
...
````


## Pimcore Plugins
It is also possible to install Pimcore plugins via composer. To do so, the plugin has to have a `composer.json` with a special type and need to be accessably for composer. 

### Plugin `composer.json`
In the plugins `composer.json` a special type (`pimcore-plugin`) and a additional requirement (`"pimcore/installer-plugin": ">=1"`) has to be defined. These two things enable composer to install plugins into */plugins* folder of Pimcore. 

```json 
{
  "name": "pimcore-plugins/MyPlugin",
  "type": "pimcore-plugin",
  "require": {
    "pimcore/installer-plugin": ">=1",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Include Plugins to Pimcore `composer.json`
To install a plugin into a Pimcore instance, just add the plugin as requirement to Pimcores `composer.json` as follows. Maybe you also need to add an additional repository to tell composer where to find the plugin. 

```json
{
    "require": {
        "pimcore-plugins/MyPlugin": "*"
    },
    "repositories": [
        { "type": "composer", "url": "https://composer-packages.mydomain.com/" }
    ]
}
```


## Pimcore Website Component
This type allows to install predefined code snippets into the folders */static* and */website*. These snippets will to be copied
to their destination only once, existing files will not be overwritten on `composer update`. So, it is possible to adapt the copied 
snippets to custom solution needs. 

### Pimcore Website Component `composer.json`
In the website components `composer.json` a special type (`pimcore-website-component`) and a additional requirement (`"pimcore/installer-website-component": "*"`) has to be defined. These two things enable composer to install the files to the desired destination folders. 

```json 
{
    "name": "pimcore-samples/default-404-error-page",
    "type": "pimcore-website-component",
	"require": {
        "pimcore/installer-website-component": "*"
    }
} 
```

### Include Pimcore Website Component to Pimcore `composer.json`
To install a Website Component into a Pimcore instance, just add it as requirement to Pimcores `composer.json` as follows. Maybe you also need to add an additional repository to tell composer where to find the plugin. 

```json
{
    "require": {
        "pimcore-samples/default-404-error-page": "*"
    },
    "repositories": [
        { "type": "composer", "url": "https://composer-packages.mydomain.com/" }
    ]
}
```

## Version Checking
To aviod compatibility problems with plugins or custom components, that are compatible with a special Pimcore version only, Pimcore
has following requirement `pimcore/core-version` that defines its current version: 

```json
{
    ...
    "require": {
        ...
        "pimcore/core-version": "4.3.1",
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

If your compontens have the same requirement to the versions they can work with, composer prevents you from installing your components
to an unsupported version of Pimcore due to version conflicts to the requirement `pimcore/core-version`.
